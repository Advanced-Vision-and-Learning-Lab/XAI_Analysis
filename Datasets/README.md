on the webpages and provided here.

## UCMerced dataset [[`BibTeX`](https://github.com/Peeples-Lab/XAI_Analysis/tree/main/Datasets#citing-ucmerced)]
To download the UCMerced dataset, initialize a new UC Merced dataset instance in which download is set to True.
The structure of the `UCMerced` folder is as follows:
```
└── root dir
    ├── UCMerced_LandUse //Contains folders of images for each class.
    ├── uc_merced-train
    ├── uc_merced-test  
	  ├── uc_merced-val
```
